# ANYFESTO - A platform from which to speak

Any manifestation of a meeting - in the schools or in the streets - is going to need clear communication. Anyfesto is the toolbox to make that happen.

Your Anyfesto server is discoverable as a Wifi access point, with web navigation leading users to your content.

By using low cost hardware and proven Open Source Software the ability to build a robust communication device is now affordable and accessible both for individuals and for community wide needs.

Anyfesto uses Raspberry Pi/CHIP computers as total communication devices. Utilizing proven Open Source Software an Anyfesto install appears to users as a Wifi access point, offering audio streaming, file sharing, text and voice communications, education content and more.

* Wifi Access Point (captive portal)

* Web pages powered by Kiwix Wikimedia Server
* IRC Server and Web Frontend
* Audio Streaming Server
